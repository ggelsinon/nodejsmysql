This node, js, mysql app functions as follows:

An inventory of items, their available qty and price are stored in a sql database:
![gif start](readmeAssets/starting_inventory.gif)


Using terminal and nodemon to interact with the application you can order products
![gif successful order 1](readmeAssets/successful_order.gif)


If there is not sufficient quantity of the item you are attempting to order you will be notified and prompted to try again
![gif insufficient qty](readmeAssets/insufficient_qty.gif)


When you try again, so long as you don't get greedy and order a reasonable amount of happines, love or security you will successfully complete your order
![gif successful order 2](readmeAssets/successful_order2.gif)


In the land of Bamazon there is a finite amount of love, security and happiness, 
so that inventory has to be tracked. Therefore after your purchase our database inventory is updated.
